The atmosphere of political confrontation in Catalonia has recently had a considerable impact in WhatsApp groups analyzed within the framework of the IMPACT-EV (Evaluating the impact and outcomes of EU SSH research) project (FP7). We developed a classification of four impacts. (a) In most cases where pro-independence supporters and Spanish nationalists have participated in WhatsApp groups, conversations about Catalan independence have broken groups up due to the groups being deleted, someone being removed, or someone leaving the group. (b) Most groups that have agreed to not speak about the issue have continued without conflict. (c) Groups that have been maintained have survived because their members hold the same political position. (d) Only some groups have persisted despite discussing the topic due to a respect for differing political positions. In this article, we analyze this reality from the conversations of different WhatsApp groups, and by employing the communicative methodology of research, we identify a predominance of links of instrumental friendship in Typology a and links of democratic friendship in Typology d.
